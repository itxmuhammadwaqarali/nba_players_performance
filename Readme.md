# Obesity Levels Estimation Model

This project builds a regression model to predict obesity levels based on dietary habits and physical conditions. The dataset contains 17 attributes and 2111 records from individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia. Obesity levels are categorized into Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Levels, and various Obesity Types.

## What Was Done

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Explored dataset trends and relationships between features.
   - Analyzed the impact of dietary habits and physical conditions on obesity levels.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features to improve predictions.
   - Standardized and normalized data for model readiness.

3. **Modeling**:
   - Trained regression models to estimate obesity levels:
     - Linear Regression
     - Ridge Regression
   - Evaluated models using R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

4. **Results**:
   - Provided accurate predictions of obesity levels.
   - Highlighted key features influencing obesity levels.
