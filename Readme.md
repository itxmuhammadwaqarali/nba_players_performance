# Obesity Levels Estimation Model

This project develops a machine learning model to estimate obesity levels based on dietary habits and physical condition. The dataset includes records from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, with 17 attributes and 2111 records. Obesity levels are classified into categories such as Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight, and various Obesity types.

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed dataset distribution and class overlaps.
   - Identified patterns in diet and physical activity influencing obesity.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Implemented four sub-models targeting specific obesity categories:
     - Insufficient-Normal Weight
     - Overweight Levels
     - Obesity Types
   - Used clustering algorithms to estimate probabilities for each level.

3. **Results**:
   - Improved classification accuracy by addressing class overlaps.
   - Provided detailed insights into key obesity predictors.
